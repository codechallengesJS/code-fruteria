# equities-client-small

This is a minimal version of the equities-client repo, containing only the essential structure and a sample swap-terms-form implementation.

🎉 Calling all code wizards and fruit fanatics! 🍌🍎

I’ve whipped up a repository that’s basically a trading app… but for fruit! Think Wall Street, but instead of stocks, we’re swapping strawberries and bananas. 🍍📊

Buuut… this fruity exchange needs a bit of love:

- First, we need to refactor the code — it’s a bit overripe.
- Then, we’ve got to upgrade to React 18 (because jumping straight to 19 would be like peeling a banana with a chainsaw).
- After that, we’ll create a light theme that’s fresher than a lemon on a summer day. ☀️
- And there’s more juicy stuff to do, but let’s take it one bite at a time.

Who’s ready to modernize this digital fruit bazaar? 🍇💻
